	  The video above is our short stop motion animation about unemployment. Unemployment is a serious social issue that is tended to be overlooked. This animation takes a comedic yet educational approach on this difficult subject.

		  This is a box-and-arrow diagram of the cycle of unemployment. These are just some of the few negative chain effects that come with unemplotment. 
		  Our intention for our stop motion animation is to hope someone walks away feeling more educated on the subject while also taking some of the tension off the topic and making the animation less tense with it's comedic scenes.
