	  The video above is our short stop motion animation about unemployment. Unemployment is a serious social issue that is tended to be overlooked. This animation takes a comedic yet educational approach on this difficult subject.

		  This is a box-and-arrow diagram of the cycle of unemployment. These are just some of the few negative chain effects that come with unemplotment. 
		  Our intention for our stop motion animation is to hope someone walks away feeling more educated on the subject while also taking some of the tension off the topic and making the animation less tense with it's comedic scenes.

		  These two images above are the components that made up our set. We mix and matched different backdrops and floor panels in order to create a variety of differnet scenes and moods.

		  The image above is a copy of one of the codes for our one of the lightings that we used in our animation. This was a very helpful tool that we used throughout our process for it provided us with bright even ligting and subtle color changes as the mood changes throughout the animation. We used this in every scene and it was a very helpful tool that brought our animation to life.

		  The two images above were our main source of structure and outline for our story. This was the sequence we continually looked back to for guidance and structure. We used these images as a guide to help us stay on track and follow our narrative which was to evoke how accommodations in the workplace is something that is actively 
		  overlooked in our society and how vicious the cycle of unemployment can be.
